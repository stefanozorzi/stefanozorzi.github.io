I run Founders, a startup studio based in Copenhagen, together with my five partners. We build products and companies that make a difference, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We know all the ups and downs of creating something from scratch. 

This is also what I love about writing: it is painful, frustrating and incredibly rewarding at the same time. On this personal blog I give myself the liberty to write down whatever comes to my mind, I often change opinion in the process of writing, or some days later. Opinions here are my former self's, if you disagree just let me know.
