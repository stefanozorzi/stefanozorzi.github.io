I run Founders, a startup studio based in Copenhagen, together with my five partners. We build products and companies that make a difference, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We know all the ups and downs of creating something from scratch. 

This is also what I love about writing: it is painful, frustrating and incredibly rewarding at the same time. On this personal blog I give myself the liberty to write down whatever comes to my mind, I often change opinion in the process of writing, or some days later. Opinions here are my former self's, if you disagree just let me know.

### On the Hiding Hand 

The *[Hiding Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_hand_principle)* is a term coined by Albert Hirschman in 1967. I discoverd it as an empirical reality before making it a philosophy of life. It is the "hidden" force that makes us embrace, and overcome, challenges we wouldn't otherwise dare to tackle. Writing is the perfect example. We write when we think we know what we want to say. We then discover our ignorance, but since we are going, it gives us the opportunity to learn something new.
